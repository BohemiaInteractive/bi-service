{@link Service} configuration is fetched from `$PROJECT_ROOT/config/$NODE_ENV/config.json5` by the service [execution procedure](https://github.com/BohemiaInteractive/bi-service/blob/master/bin/bi-service.js#L96).  
[JSON5](https://github.com/json5/json5) format is used which is basically less strict javascript-like `JSON`.

General description of service configuration options is defined by the ajv [validation schema](https://github.com/BohemiaInteractive/bi-service/blob/master/lib/configSchema.js).  
Extra configuration features whithin the `config.json5` are described in the [bi-config](https://github.com/BohemiaInteractive/bi-config) package.

```javascript
    // $PROJECT_ROOT/index.js
    const Service = require('bi-service');
    const config  = require('bi-config');
    const service = new Service(config);

    service.config.get() //returns contents of $PROJECT_ROOT/config/$NODE_ENV/config.json5
    service.config.get('storage:postgres'); //returns nested value of the postgres property
```

Each {@link App} of {@link AppManager} has its own configuration scope which is populated with `service.config.get('apps.<app_name>')` once on the App initialization.

```javascript

   service.appManager.get('myapp').config.get() //returns value of service.config.get('apps:myapp')
```
