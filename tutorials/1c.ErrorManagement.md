`Route`'s internal middleware stack execution works with Promises ([bluebirdjs](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/getting-started.html)).

```javascript

//...
const route = router.buildRoute({/*options*/});

route.main(function(req, res) {
    return asyncProcedure();
}).catch(TypeError, function(err) {
    err.message === 'error message'; //true
});

function asyncProcedure() {
    return Promise.reject(new TypeError('error message'));
}

```

All errors which happen in a request lifecycle get eventually processed by internal [errorHandler](https://github.com/BohemiaInteractive/bi-service/blob/master/lib/middleware/errorHandler.js) middleware.  
Service {@link App} can respond on a request with {@link RequestError} only thus all other errors which don't extend the {@link RequestError} are coerced to meet the condition (converted to {@link ServiceError}).  
All unexpected errors - aka all errors which do NOT inherit {@link RequestError} (except the {@link ServiceError} which is handled as an error exception thus considered the unexpected error) - trigger {@link App#event:error} event on {@link App} instance object.  
All unexpected errors are logged to configured remote destination with the [bi-logger](https://github.com/BohemiaInteractive/bi-logger) package.  
See bi-service {@link ErrorList} for the list of built-in Error types.  

You can influence the way errors are processed by the following events:  

- {@link App#event:error}
- {@link App#event:unknown-error}
- {@link App#event:error-response}
