`Route`'s internal middleware stack execution works with Promises.

```javascript

let error = new Error('gets handled asynchronously');

//...
const route = router.buildRoute({/*options*/});

route.main(function(req, res) {
    throw error;
}).catch(function(err) {
    err === error; //true
});

```

All errors which happen in a request lifecycle get eventually processed by internal [errorHandler](https://github.com/BohemiaInteractive/bi-service/blob/master/lib/middleware/errorHandler.js) middleware.  
Service {@link App} can respond with {@link RequestError} only thus all other errors which don't extend the {@link RequestError} are coerced to meet the condition.  
See the bi-service {@link ErrorList}.  

You can influence the way errors are processed by the following events:  

- {@link App#event:error}
- {@link App#event:unknown-error}
- {@link App#event:error-response}
